SUMMARY:Phase 1 Kick-off: Finalize Brand Identity & Handles
DESCRIPTION:Source: Section 1.1 - Forging the "AI MrBeast"\n\nOBJECTIVE: 
 Select the final brand name and secure it across all platforms. A brandab
 le handle is a cornerstone of digital identity. The success of this ventu
 re is contingent not merely on the sophistication of its automation but o
 n the ability to automate a brand that resonates deeply with its target a
 udience.\n\nDECISION: Choose one from your top 5 (Bytegeist, Glitch Gosp
 el, The Silicon Prophet, Zero-Day Digest, Cortex & Commentary). Recomme
 ndation: 'Bytegeist' as it merges "Byte" with "Zeitgeist," positioning t
 he brand as capturing the essential spirit of the current technological e
 ra.\n\nACTION: Register the chosen handle on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram
 , and a corresponding domain/email.
